    NOTE: The link at the start of the page and under the photos should be STRICTLY THE SAME. Or it does not compile.
    I don't know the reason, but here is the only way I found to make it work:
    If you add a new people in the list:
    `PREFIX NAME <LINK>`_
    Then the table:
    1. The caption should be the same as the link, which is 'PREFIX NAME'.
    2. Not all of the caption 'PREFIX NAME' should be the name of the link, at lest the first word is not in the caption, such as PREFIX `NAME <LINK>`_
    3. I use the empty space emoji as the prefix.
