Research
======================

In this tutorial you will create a documentation project on Read the Docs
by importing a Sphinx project from a GitHub repository,
tailor its configuration, and explore several useful features of the platform.

The tutorial is aimed at people interested in learning
how to use Read the Docs to host their documentation projects.
You will fork a fictional software library
similar to the one developed in the :doc:`official Sphinx tutorial <sphinx:tutorial/index>`.
No prior experience with Sphinx is required
and you can follow this tutorial without having done the Sphinx one.

The only things you will need are
a web browser, an Internet connection, and a GitHub account
(you can `register for a free account <https://github.com/signup>`_ if you don't have one).
You will use Read the Docs Community, which means that the project will be public.

Getting started
---------------

Preparing your project on GitHub
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To start, `sign in to GitHub <https://github.com/login>`_
and navigate to `the tutorial GitHub template <https://github.com/readthedocs/tutorial-template/>`_,
where you will see a green :guilabel:`Use this template` button.
Click it to open a new page that will ask you for some details:

* Leave the default "Owner", or change it to something better for a tutorial project.
* Introduce an appropriate "Repository name", for example ``rtd-tutorial``.
* Make sure the project is "Public", rather than "Private".

After that, click on the green :guilabel:`Create repository from template` button,
which will generate a new repository on your personal account
(or the one of your choosing).
This is the repository you will import on Read the Docs,
and it contains the following files:

``README.rst``
  Basic description of the repository, you will leave it untouched.

``pyproject.toml``
  Python project metadata that makes it installable.
